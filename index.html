            <h1>Best Smartphones</h1>

            <p>
                Choosing a smartphone can be hard. So, we give you our pick of the best smartphones for the money
                to help you make a purchase decision.

            <h2>10.or&nbsp;E (<a href="https://www.amazon.in/10-Beyond-Black-2-GB/dp/B071Z97ZV6" target="_blank">Rs. 7,999</a>)</h2>
            <img src="img/10ore.jpg" alt="10.or E smartphone" height="320">
            <p>
                The <a href="https://10or.com/10or-E-details.html">10.or&nbsp;E</a> is a well balanced budget Android phone.
                It ticks almost all the right boxes; Full&nbsp;HD 5.5" display with Gorilla&nbsp;Glass protection,
                a large 4000&nbsp;mAH battery, stock android, a decent entry-level Snapdragon&nbsp;430 SoC with 16&nbsp;GB storage/2&nbsp;GB RAM, and the full suite
                of sensors including compass and fingerprint scanner. The camera is average at best, but that's to be expected in this price bracket.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's always something to quibble about, however. The power button in the 10.or&nbsp;E is placed above the volume rockers,
                which makes it a bit hard to reach for those with small hands. If you're looking for a compact phone, the
                Redmi&nbsp;4 is a good option, though it comes with the heavily skinned MIUI.

            <p>
                In this price range, steer clear of the Moto&nbsp;C&nbsp;Plus since it doesn't have the proximity
                sensor (the display won't switch on/off automatically when making phone calls). Also, give the Nokia&nbsp;3
                a miss unless you really want NFC, since it's rather expensive for what it offers.

            <h2>Lenovo K8 Plus (<a href="https://www.flipkart.com/lenovo-k8-plus-venom-black-32-gb/p/itmex9kpgkxmgpzc" target="_blank">Rs. 10,999</a>)</h2>
            <img src="img/lenovo-k8-plus.jpeg" alt="Lenovo K8 Plus" height="320">
            <p>
                The <a href="https://www3.lenovo.com/in/en/smartphones/smartphone-k-series/Lenovo-K8-Plus/p/WMD00000339" target="_blank">Lenovo K8 Plus</a> is among the first phones from Lenovo to feature stock android. 
                It's a solid offering with the power-efficient Helio&nbsp;P25 SoC and has 32&nbsp;GB of storage and 3&nbsp;GB of RAM. 
                The 5.2"&nbsp;IPS&nbsp;LCD panel comes with Gorilla&nbsp;Glass protection.
                All the common sensors including compass and fingerprint scanner are available.
                The 4000&nbsp;mAh battery is enough to last more than a day even with heavy usage.
                There is also an additional "music key" on the left side of the phone that can be configured to perform
                functions such as playing music, taking screenshots, and opening the camera app.
            </p>
            <p>
                A dual camera setup is on the rear. The 13&nbsp;MP primary camera is decent in this price bracket.
                However, the implementation of depth sensing with the secondary 5&nbsp;MP camera is piss poor. It takes a long time
                (multiple seconds) to capture photos in the depth enabled mode and even then, the background blur is too
                aggressive and frequently blurs the edges of the foreground object. So, don't buy this phone for the dual camera,
                and as long as you ignore that, it's a respectable all-round device.

            <p>
                The Moto&nbsp;E4&nbsp;Plus, Redmi&nbsp;Note&nbsp;4, and Lenovo&nbsp;K8&nbsp;Note are noteable phones in this price bracket that are hard to recommend.
                The Moto&nbsp;E4&nbsp;Plus has a larger 5000&nbsp;mAh battery, which makes the phone rather heavy.
                But since it has the older, less-efficient MT6737 SoC, battery life isn't that much better. 
                Additionally, it lacks the compass sensor. The Redmi&nbsp;Note&nbsp;4, on the
                other hand, is starting to show it's age. It's still on Android 6 and the camera is poor.
                The Lenovo&nbsp;K8&nbsp;Note has a more powerful deca-core Helio&nbsp;x23 SoC. But, it is less power-efficient, and the power drain
                on idle is quite high. It also retains all the flaws in the dual camera setup of the K8&nbsp;Plus.
