            <h2>Redmi&nbsp;5A (<a href="https://www.flipkart.com/redmi-5a-gold-16-gb/p/itmfybchff6m5uvc" target="_blank">Rs.&nbsp;4,999</a>)</h2>
            <img src="img/redmi-5a.jpeg" alt="Redmi 5A smartphone" height="320">
            <p>
                The <a href="http://www.mi.com/in/redmi-5a/specs/">Redmi&nbsp;5A</a> is the cheapest phone that you might consider buying.
                The 2&nbsp;GB RAM&nbsp;/&nbsp;16&nbsp;GB storage variant offers tremendous value for money with 
                a 5&nbsp;inch 720p IPS display, 3000&nbsp;mAh battery, and dual SIM slots.
                When it comes to sensors, Xiaomi has cut corners. This phone lacks a fingerprint scanner, and the compass sensor is also missing.
                But, this is a really inexpensive phone, so it's hard to complain. The camera performance is merely acceptable,
                but exceeds expectations at this price point.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like all the other Redmi phones, the Redmi&nbsp;5A uses MIUI, a heavily
                skinned version of Android. So, this phone is not for you if you're looking for a cheap stock android phone.
                The other potential issue with this phone is that the speaker grills are on the back, so the ringtone might
                get muffled when you keep the phone on your bed. Looking past these minor issues, the Redmi&nbsp;5A offers fantastic
                value for money.

            </ul>
            <p>
                At this price point, the Redmi&nbsp;5A thoroughly beats the competition. The Moto&nbsp;C, with half the RAM and missing
                proximity sensor, doesn't even come close to what the Redmi&nbsp;5A has to offer, and the Nokia&nbsp;2 isn't even in
                the race.

            <h2>10.or&nbsp;E (<a href="https://www.amazon.in/10-Beyond-Black-2-GB/dp/B071Z97ZV6" target="_blank">Rs.&nbsp;7,999</a>)</h2>
            <img src="img/10ore.jpg" alt="10.or E smartphone" height="320">
            <p>
                The <a href="https://10or.com/10or-E-details.html">10.or&nbsp;E</a> is a well balanced budget Android phone.
                It ticks almost all the right boxes; Full&nbsp;HD 5.5" display with Gorilla&nbsp;Glass protection,
                a large 4000&nbsp;mAH battery, stock android, a decent entry-level Snapdragon&nbsp;430 SoC with 16&nbsp;GB storage/2&nbsp;GB RAM, and the full suite
                of sensors including the fingerprint scanner. The camera is average at best, but that's to be expected in this price bracket.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's always something to quibble about, however. The power button in the 10.or&nbsp;E is placed above the volume rockers,
                which makes it a bit hard to reach for those with small hands. If you're looking for a compact phone, the
                Redmi&nbsp;4 is a good option, though it comes with the heavily skinned MIUI.

            </ul>
            <p>
                In this price range, steer clear of the Moto&nbsp;C&nbsp;Plus since it doesn't have the proximity
                sensor (the display won't switch on/off automatically when making phone calls). Also, give the Nokia&nbsp;3
                a miss unless you really want NFC, since it's rather expensive for what it offers.

            <h2>Lenovo&nbsp;K8&nbsp;Plus (<a href="https://www.flipkart.com/lenovo-k8-plus-venom-black-32-gb/p/itmex9kpgkxmgpzc" target="_blank">Rs.&nbsp;10,999</a>)</h2>
            <img src="img/lenovo-k8-plus.jpeg" alt="Lenovo K8 Plus" height="320">
            <p>
                The <a href="https://www3.lenovo.com/in/en/smartphones/smartphone-k-series/Lenovo-K8-Plus/p/WMD00000339" target="_blank">Lenovo K8 Plus</a> is among the first phones from Lenovo to feature stock android.
                It's a solid offering with the power-efficient Helio&nbsp;P25 SoC and has 32&nbsp;GB of storage and 3&nbsp;GB of RAM.
                The 5.2"&nbsp;IPS&nbsp;LCD panel comes with Gorilla&nbsp;Glass protection.
                All the common sensors including the fingerprint scanner are available.
                The 4000&nbsp;mAh battery is enough to last more than a day even with heavy usage.
                There is also an additional "music key" on the left side of the phone that can be configured to perform
                functions such as playing music, taking screenshots, and opening the camera app.
            </p>
            <p>
                A dual camera setup is on the rear. The 13&nbsp;MP primary camera is decent in this price bracket.
                However, the implementation of depth sensing with the secondary 5&nbsp;MP camera is piss poor. It takes a long time
                (multiple seconds) to capture photos in the depth enabled mode and even then, the background blur is too
                aggressive and frequently blurs the edges of the foreground object. So, don't buy this phone for the dual camera,
                and as long as you ignore that, it's a respectable all-round device.

            </ul>
            <p>
                The Moto&nbsp;E4&nbsp;Plus, Redmi&nbsp;Note&nbsp;4, and Lenovo&nbsp;K8&nbsp;Note are noteable phones in this price bracket that are hard to recommend.
                The Moto&nbsp;E4&nbsp;Plus has a larger 5000&nbsp;mAh battery, which makes the phone rather heavy.
                But since it has the older, less-efficient MT6737 SoC, battery life isn't that much better.
                Additionally, it lacks the compass sensor. The Redmi&nbsp;Note&nbsp;4, on the
                other hand, is starting to show it's age. It's still on Android 6, and the camera is poor.
                The Lenovo&nbsp;K8&nbsp;Note has a more powerful deca-core Helio&nbsp;x23 SoC. But, it is less power-efficient, and the power drain
                on idle is quite high. It also retains all the flaws in the dual camera setup of the K8&nbsp;Plus.

            <p>
                The <a href="http://www.mi.com/in/mi-a1/specs/" target="_blank">Xiaomi&nbsp;Mi&nbsp;A1</a> is the first mid-range smartphone launched as part of the Android One program.
                It is powered by an octa-core Snapdragon&nbsp;625 SoC with 64&nbsp;GB of storage and 4&nbsp;GB of RAM.
                The 3080&nbsp;mAh should last an entire day with moderate usage.
                All the common sensors including the fingerprint scanner are present (no NFC).
                A dual camera setup with a wide-angle sensor and a telephoto sensor is on the rear,
                and the depth sensing portrait mode is decent and much faster than the implementation in the competing Moto&nbsp;G5S&nbsp;Plus.
                The phone was launched with stock Android Nougat, but updates to Android Oreo and even Android P are promised.
            </p>
            <img src="img/moto-g5s-plus.jpg" alt="Moto G5S Plus" height="320">

                The <a href="https://www.motorola.in/products/moto-g-plus-gen-5-special-edition" target="_blank">Moto&nbsp;G5S&nbsp;Plus</a>
                is a strong competitor to the Mi&nbsp;A1 and has similar specs. The primary difference is in the camera setup.
                The rear camera in the Moto&nbsp;G5S&nbsp;Plus has one color sensor and one monochrome sensor. The monochrome sensor
                helps the Moto&nbsp;G5S&nbsp;Plus outperform the Mi&nbsp;A1 in low-light. Additionally, the Moto&nbsp;G5S&nbsp;Plus
                has electronic image stabilization (EIS) that helps in stabilizing videos, but this is absent in the Mi&nbsp;A1.
                To further sweeten the deal, the Moto&nbsp;G5S&nbsp;Plus has NFC and fast charging, neither of which is supported by the Mi&nbsp;A1.
                Strangely, however, the Moto&nbsp;G5S&nbsp;Plus lacks a compass sensor which can be really useful when walking
                around in an unfamiliar location. If the missing compass isn't a concern and you don't take a lot of portrait shots in quick succession,
                the Moto&nbsp;G5S&nbsp;Plus is the one to go with. Otherwise, the Mi&nbsp;A1 is a great choice.

            <p>
                At this price point, the Nokia&nbsp;6 is another competitor.
                Unless you really care about the Nokia nostalgia, give the Nokia&nbsp;6 a miss.
                It has a much slower processor, less storage, and a worse camera.

                The <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/specs/" target="_blank">iPhone&nbsp;SE</a> is basically a refresh of the iPhone&nbsp;5S.
                It keeps the small 4&nbsp;inch form factor and the design of the older iPhone&nbsp;5S but the internals are upgraded to mostly match the iPhone&nbsp;6S.
                It's easily the best small phone you can buy today. All the common sensors including the fingerprint scanner are available.
                Although it has a relatively small battery, the battery life is actually pretty good since it has a small screen.
                A huge advantage of choosing an iPhone is that iOS has better security and is more privacy conscious than Android, and
                Apple updates iPhones for many more years than your typical Android smartphone.

            <p>
                The major downside of the iPhone&nbsp;SE is that the screen is rather small. If you're looking for a bigger phone in this price
                segment, the <a href="https://www.motorola.in/products/moto-x-gen-4" target="_blank">Moto&nbsp;X4</a> is hard to beat.
                It comes with a Snapdragon&nbsp;630 octa-core processor running stock android 7.1, 3/4&nbsp;GB RAM and 32/64&nbsp;GB storage.
                The 5.2&nbsp;inch screen is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass, and the phone is water resistant (IP68). 
                The 3000&nbsp;mAh battery should suffice for a day of moderate usage, but if you need a bit more juice during the day,
                the phone supports quick charging. The dual camera on the back is decent but lacks the finesse of the flagship phones.
                All the usual sensors including the finger print scanner and NFC are present.

                The <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-7/specs/">iPhone&nbsp;7</a> has an A10 quad-core SoC with 2&nbsp;GB of RAM.
                It comes with a 4.7&nbsp;inch display, and the phone is water resistant (IP67 rated).
                The specs are top-notch, and really when it comes to the flagships, every phone has fantastic specs, so it isn't something to worry about.
                The camera on this phone has optical image stabilization and is one of the best. It's just a really good phone.
                The big downsides are (a) there's no headphone jack, and (b) the battery life, while decent, isn't the best, 
                so for heavy users, the iPhone&nbsp;7&nbsp;Plus is a better option.

                It's hard to recommend an Android phone at this price point. When you look at privacy, security, and software updates, iPhone
                obliterates any competition from Android. Most Android phones get hardly a year of software support, but Apple continues
                to update the 4 year old iPhone&nbsp;5S. If you are absolutely sure you want an Android phone, consider Nokia&nbsp;8 and Google Pixel.
                Avoid the OnePlus phones if you value <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/880802/OnePlus-warning-private-photos-selfies-Android-privacy-hackers">your privacy</a>.
                They have <a href="https://twitter.com/fs0c131y/status/930115188988182531">piss poor</a> security <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15694318">practices</a>.
                Also, OnePlus tried to cheat their customers by <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-5-benchmark-cheating-reviews/">manipulating benchmarks</a>.

                The <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-x/specs/">iPhone&nbsp;X</a> has an Apple&nbsp;A11 hexa-core SoC with 3&nbsp;GB of RAM.
                Even though it has a tall 5.8&nbsp;inch display, the phone itself is quite compact because the display is bezel-less.
                The specs on flagship phones have gotten so good that they're hardly worth bringing up in a review, and the iPhone&nbsp;X is no exception.
                The phone has fantastic cameras and is water resistant (IP67 rated). The big change from the previous iPhones is that the home
                button is gone, and Touch&nbsp;ID has been replaced by Face&nbsp;ID.

                If you don't like the tall bezel-less display or Face&nbsp;ID, consider the iPhone&nbsp;8. Android phones pale in comparison
                to iPhones when it comes to security and privacy, but if you're dead set on an Android phone, the Google Pixel&nbsp;2 is a good choice.
                However, it's bigger brother, the Pixel&nbsp;2&nbsp;XL, has a number of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Rv6h55ZDiE">reported issues</a>
                that you should <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/4/16605144/pixel-2-xl-screen-oled-color-shift-issues-ping-counterping">look into</a> if you are
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvNis_A6UaI">considering</a> that.
